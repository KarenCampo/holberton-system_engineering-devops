## Concepts

### * What is a DNS:
It is the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP

### What is Monitoring:
In software, monitoring watches the  computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly.

### What is a Web Server:
A web server is a software that delivers web pages.

### What is a Load Balancer:
A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers.

### What is a Server:
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.
